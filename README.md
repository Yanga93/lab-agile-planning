# lab-agile-planning

## Anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum
- No real product owner
- Teams are too large
- Teams are not dedicated
- Teams are too geographically distributed
- Teams are siloed
- Teams are not sef-managing

## Scrum health check
- A sprint planning a forecast, a sprint backlog, and a sprint goal are created. 
- The result of the daily Scrum is work being re-planned for the next day
- No later than by the end of the sprint, a Dne increment is created
- Stakeholders offer feedback as a result of inspecting the increment at the sprint review
- Product backlog is updated as a result of the sprint review
- Product owner, development team(s), and Scrum master align on the work process for their next sprint at the sprint retrospective
